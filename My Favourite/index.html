        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p class="para">Drawing is a form of visual art in which an artist uses instruments to mark paper
             or other two-dimensional surface.  Each time we draw we access our imagination and make physical representations of what's in our
              mind. People's imaginations have allowed them to create all of the things that we use and are surrounded by everyday. 
              Drawing is fun because it is a form of self-expression. You can make it whatever you want it to be, and
               create what you wish. It has the power to educate people about almost anything. It can create awareness and present
                information in a way that could be absorbed by many easily. In a world where there are those who don't even have
                 access to good education, art makes education an even greater equalizer of society.</p>
